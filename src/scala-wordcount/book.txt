The adoption of microservice solution has bring real values to make the IT solution development more agile, in control of limited, humanly manageable scope, with high velocity of change, from idea to production.  DevOps practices have empowered developers to understand operations challenges and develop better, more robust code. With microservice, development practices embraced distributed computing challenges and problems like eventual consistence, availability and replication. In 15 years the technology landscape move from ‘pet type’ Java based application deployed on cherished application servers to ‘cattle like’ polyglot micro applications deployed on clusters with container orchestration capabilities. Those new way of developing came with the adoption of Cloud platform where computer servers are created in minutes, and can be destroy in seconds. The flexibility of the platform to add more compute resource, is not enough to bring business value. The real value, is when developers work closely with business, business analyst, product owner to define business hypothesis, supported by new application features, deployable to production in very short term, like one or two weeks.
